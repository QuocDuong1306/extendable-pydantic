From Pydantic 2.5.0 the FieldInfo class is no more available in the pydantic.main
module. It's only available in the pydantic.fields module. The import from the
pydantic.main module was a mistake since it relied on an transitive import from
pydantic.fields to pydantic.main. This is no more the case in Pydantic 2.5.0.
